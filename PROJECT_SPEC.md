## Project Spec: SPX 0–14 DTE Options Trading Platform (MVP: 3/5/7 DTE Credit Verticals)

### Executive summary
- **Goal**: Build a reproducible research + paper execution platform for **SPX index options** (not SPY), focusing on **credit vertical spreads** with 0–14 DTE (MVP uses 3/5/7 DTE).
- **Primary outputs**:
  - A live system that **snapshots SPX option chains every 5 minutes**, computes context + signals, and can **place paper multi-leg orders via Tradier sandbox**.
  - A backtester that uses **the same trade definitions, risk rules, and pricing conventions** as live.
  - A dataset suitable for iterative ML improvements (stored features, decisions, fills, and outcomes).

### What we are (and are not) building in v1
- **In scope (v1 / MVP)**:
  - SPX **credit vertical spreads only** (2 legs).
  - DTE targets: **3 DTE, 5 DTE, 7 DTE**.
  - Entry times: **10:00, 11:00, 12:00 America/New_York** (no other entries).
  - Delta targeting: **short-leg absolute delta targets 0.10 and 0.20** (two candidate setups).
  - Management: **close-only** with:
    - **Take profit**: close at **50% of max profit**.
    - **Stop loss**: close at **-100% of max profit** (i.e., loss equals collected credit).
  - Fixed position sizing (fixed contracts).
  - Minimal web dashboard for monitoring.
- **Out of scope (v1)**:
  - Iron condors / iron butterflies.
  - Rolling rules.
  - Tick-level replay.
  - Full-chain WebSocket streaming of all SPX options symbols.

### Key feasibility constraints (design choices to avoid failure modes)
- **Live chain capture**: Do not attempt to subscribe to the entire SPX chain via streaming. Instead, **pull REST snapshots every 5 minutes** and store them.
- **Paper fills**: Prefer **Tradier sandbox order placement** so fills/partials/rejects are broker-derived. Maintain a fallback fill simulator for offline backtests.
- **Reproducibility**: Store the **exact chain snapshot and context used** to make each decision.

## Tech stack
- **Language**: Python 3.10+
- **Live host**: Railway (Docker)
- **Live DB**: PostgreSQL (Railway)
- **Backtest DB**: DuckDB (local)
- **ML**: XGBoost (optional in MVP; allow rule-based gating first)
- **Web UI**: FastAPI + simple frontend (or server-rendered pages) backed by Postgres

## Data strategy

### Live data (Tradier)
- **Option chain snapshots** (REST): SPX options chain for each target expiration (3/5/7 DTE as available) with Greeks/IV as provided by Tradier.
- **Macro/context inputs** (REST where possible):
  - VIX and VIX9D quotes (if available via Tradier symbols)
  - Optional additional proxies (rates, etc.) only if reliable
- **Scheduling**:
  - Every **5 minutes** during regular trading hours (RTH).
  - Additionally, ensure snapshots exist at **10:00, 11:00, 12:00 ET** (entry decision times). If a scheduled tick lands exactly on these, reuse it.

### Historical data (Databento)
- **Dataset**: `OPRA.PILLAR` filtered to **SPX options**
- **Schema**: **`CBBO-1m`** as primary (NBBO + last sale at 1-minute intervals; sufficient for bar-level backtests)
- **Also download**:
  - **Instrument definitions** for options symbology/metadata (expiry/strike/right)
  - Optional: **Trades** schema for later liquidity/slippage research

## Trading rules (MVP)

### Trade type: SPX credit vertical spreads
- Two legs:
  - **Short** option (sell to open)
  - **Long** option (buy to open) at same expiration, farther OTM (defines risk)

### DTE targets
- Attempt to trade at **3, 5, 7 DTE** only.
- If no exact match exists due to calendar/holidays, select the closest expiration within a tolerance (configurable; default ±1 DTE) or skip.

### Entry times
- Consider entries only at:
  - **10:00 ET**
  - **11:00 ET**
  - **12:00 ET**
- At each entry time, if an active trade is open, **do not open a new trade**.

### Leg selection (delta-based)
- For each candidate setup (0.10 and 0.20 absolute delta):
  - Choose the option whose absolute delta is closest to target.
  - Define long leg farther OTM such that the spread width is consistent (configurable, e.g., 25/50 points) or derived from delta distance.
- Select the better candidate by score (rule-based initially; ML later).

### Management (close-only)
- **Profit target**: close when current PnL ≥ 0.50 × max_profit.
- **Stop loss**: close when current PnL ≤ -1.00 × max_profit.
- **Session exit**: optionally close all open positions near end of day (configurable; default off for 3/5/7 DTE unless needed).

### Position sizing
- **Fixed contracts** (configurable integer).

### Portfolio-level risk limits (MVP defaults)
- **Max open trades**: 1
- **Max new trades/day**: 1
- **Daily stop**: if a stop loss occurs, disable new entries for remainder of day
- **Event blackout**: if a high-impact event is within N hours, skip entries (optional table-driven)

## Pricing & fill assumptions (backtest and analytics)

### Live paper execution
- Place paper orders via Tradier sandbox:
  - Prefer **multi-leg order** API (`class=multileg`) even for 2 legs for consistency.
  - Use **credit limit orders** where supported; otherwise a controlled market/credit type with guardrails.
- Store:
  - preview response (if used)
  - submission payload
  - order id(s)
  - fills (including partial fills) and timestamps

### Backtest fill model (default)
- Use NBBO mid with conservative slippage:
  - Credit entry fill: `mid - 0.30 * (ask - bid)`
  - Credit exit fill: `mid + 0.30 * (ask - bid)`
- **No partial fills** in v1 backtest.

### Mark-to-market
- Mark each leg at mid; compute spread value from legs; compute PnL from entry credit vs current value.

## Notes / future extensions
- Add condors/butterflies after the vertical pipeline is stable.
- Add rolling rules after fill + PnL parity is validated between paper and backtest.
- Consider higher-frequency NBBO schemas only if the 1-minute model proves insufficient.
